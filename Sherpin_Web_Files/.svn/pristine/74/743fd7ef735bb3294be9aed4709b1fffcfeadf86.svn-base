    <h1>Setting up Sherpas!</h1>

    <p class="bold">
    Welcome to Sherpin.com, where media sherpas know how to access a lot of the media available on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can define as many sherpas as you want, and all will search for media
    relevant to their definition. You could set up very targeted sherpas, such as those that find media related to the
    Seattle Sounders or to a specific actor. You could also set up more general sherpas, such as those that find boxing
    matches or spy movies.<br />
    
    To get started, let's define two sherpas: one for finding Abbott and Costello routines and the other
    to find media involving the Washington Huskies.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, let's create a sherpa for Abbott and Costello. The upper textbox allows you to name your sherpa. Since we want
    one that finds routines involving Abbott and Costello, type in "Abbott and Costello". We can also give the sherpa a
    description, to help us remember what this sherpa is helping us find. In the second text box, type "Routines involving
    Abbott and Costello".
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, we want to give the sherpa hints for what to look for. In MyMediaGuide, we have three list boxes to work with.
    The Keywords listbox allows you to define as many keywords as you want. Note that, as you make changes to these list boxes, this page
    area will update with a sample set of results (the top 20) that fit. That gives you instant feedback on how your changes
    affect what the sherpa finds (and it also means you'll lose this instruction page).
    
    Click on the listbox for Keywords, and you see
    a text box with <i>&lt;Add new keyword&gt;</i> in the contents. Clear that out, and type "Bud Abbott" and press enter.
    Notice that that keyword is now in the list box, along with a checked checkbox. In keywords, you have three states: active,
    exclude, and not used. If the check box is checked, then the keyword is active and the sherpa searches for media that is
    associated with that keyword. If the checkbox has a - symbol, then the keyword is excluded, and any video with that keyword
    removed from the search (for example, you may not want to include Bud Abbott movies that also have the keyword "porn"). Finally,
    if the checkbox is unchecked, the that keyword will not be involved in the media search. Go ahead and also 
    add the keyword "Lou Costello", and "who's on first". For now, that's enough keywords. <br />
    
    We can also specify
    which sources to target for these media. Certainly bnwmovies (Black and White Movies) would be a good start, and probably
    Netflix and Hulu. Go ahead and check those. ESPN probably won't find much, so no use in checking that one. YouTube and Vimeo are more
    open media sources, and so you might find some good results, but you may also find some more obscure matches. We suggest trying
    those sources to see how well they'll work for you.<br />

    Finally, you can choose which genres to choose from. Sherpas will give more value to those media items marked in
    those genres but will also return media not in that genre but still seem to fit in the results, so you won't see as
    much variation in this setting as in the other two. Go ahead and choose movies and comedies for that one.
    </p>
    <p>
    That's it. You've made your first Sherpa. A second sherpa for Washington Huskies would be relatively straight-forward.
    You can name it however you want, then give it a meaningful description. Keywords might include "washington huskies",
    "university of washington", "go dawgs", and "husky football". Certainly ESPN is a good channel here, as are youtube
    and hulu. bnwmovies.com probably won't be as helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Good luck creating your sherpas. And please give feedback using the llink below. Your feedback is very helpful to us.
