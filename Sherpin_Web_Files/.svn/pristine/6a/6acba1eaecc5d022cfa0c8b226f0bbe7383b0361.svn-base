    <h1>Filling your backpack</h1>

    <p class="bold">
    You have Sherpas now, but your backpack is empty. Let's fill it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your backpack stores all the media you've found that you want to make sure to keep in your results. You may have
    noticed the ``pin'' image next to media in your other sherpas. That pins your media to your sherpa, so you will always
    be able to retrieve it. In fact, pinned items always show up at the top of your sherpa results list.
    </p>
    <p>
    The backpack lists all pinned items, from all sherpas. So go to one of your other sherpas and
    pin it. When you pin that item, return to your backpack. Notice that you also see that pinned
    item here in your backpack. Your backpack gives you an easy way to find all your pinned media.
    </p>
    <p>
    Good luck with your backpack. And please give feedback in the space below. Your feedback is very useful to us.
