    <h1>Welcome to sherpin.com!</h1>
    <p class="bold">
    Welcome to sherpin.com, where media sherpas know how to access a lot of the media available on the web.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
    In sherpin.com, you set up as many sherpas as you want. You tell each sherpa what kind of media you're
    interested in, and where to look for that media. The sherpas then access the media you asked for, and make
    that media available to you with just a click.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
    Check with your sherpas often to get the most recent media items. Our spiders are hard at work checking with
    many media sources, and find new items every minute. New items will be bold-faced.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
    So get started. Click on the tools image
    <a href="bin/Tools">

    </a>
    at the bottom of the left column to start defining your sherpas now.
